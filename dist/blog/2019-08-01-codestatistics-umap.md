  We visualize large collections of Haskell and Python source codes as 2D maps using methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and dimensionality reduction and find a surprisingly rich structure for both languages. Clustering on the 2D maps allows us to identify common patterns in source code which give rise to these structures. Finally, we discuss this first analysis in the context of advanced machine learning.
