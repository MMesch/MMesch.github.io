summary: |
  Hi, I am a software developer and project manager and this is a place
  where I write up notes and thoughts.
what: |
  I am a generalist programmer and project manager. I enjoy coordinating
  projects, deciphering business requirements, looking for the path to make
  things happen all the way to implementing hands-on if required. For all my
  life, I have had a strong inclination to sports and music and try to apply
  lessons learned in this world to the still young programming industry.  My
  experience living across countries in a highly multicultural environment is
  helpful as well to bring together people.
domains: |
  I started my career at University with degrees in general Physics, worked a
  bit in Biophysics, and finally got a PhD and Post Doc in Geophysics working
  in seismology on wave propagation, tomography, and signal processing. The
  red-line here was to understand and implement mathematical models with the
  computer. After my Post Doc I switched to the software industry and have
  since worked and coordinated projects in the Quantitative Marketing,
  Fintech, Biopharma, and Aeronautics domains.
stack: |
  I have worked with a variety of programming languages and frameworks. My
  academic experience turned around large parralel Fortran simulation codes
  and the Python data and machine learning stack. In the industry, I have
  worked with standard technology such as Java Groovy, Ruby, Typescript and
  more specialized purely functional frameworks in Elm, Type- or Purescript,
  to Haskell. I discovered and learned to love Nix and NixOS over the last
  years. On the non-programming side, I worked on modeling for a large part
  of my career and have a good understanding of signal processing, differential
  equation solvers, Bayesian statistics, inverse methods and data-driven
  machine learning. In all those fields, I always enjoyed putting
  together nice and effective data visualizations, initially with matplotlib,
  d3.js and nowadays often with Vega.
