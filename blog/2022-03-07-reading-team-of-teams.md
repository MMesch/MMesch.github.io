  I read through another book on team organization: Team of Teams by Stanley McChrystal. Here are my thoughts.
---

Team of Team's is an acclaimed book about a leadership model that moves away from top-down, hierarchical management to a decentralized “Team of Teams”. McChrystal has developed this approach as response to the US Army's fight against Al-Qaeda in Iraq, because his organization wasn't able to react fast enough to succeed with this challenge.

The core premise of the book is that the world has become faster paced and more connected than ever before. In general, organizations are faced with complex systems, and breaking it apart to come up with efficient plans takes is often impossible and takes way too long to react in a timely manner. Solving problems with stratified reductionism and hierarchical approaches, ideal for efficient, simple and static processes, don't work anymore. Such linear thinking («breaking a problem apart») creates bottlenecks in many situations and makes organizations slow and ineffective because they can't offer the right solution at the right moment. A decentralized structure with it's nonlinear interactions («the sum is more than the parts») can be a lot more powerful. Resilience, that is the ability to recover from mistakes, and agility are more important in the fast-paced world. A manager in this approach is a “gardener” who fosters, eyes on, hands off, an ecosystem, working on producing the right environment rather than directly on the solution.

McChrystal uses the words “command” for the top-down, and “team” for the networked, decentralized model. The former is good for planned efficiency but creates bottlenecks, the latter is good for scalability, resilience and adaptability. The idea of McChrystal's leadership model, is not only to introduce teams. This has of course already been done with success, with team sizes of dozens of members. But team idea is often implemented as “command of teams”, where a top-down manager directs teams instead of individuals. This approach generates the same problems on the larger scale. The new idea of the book is to move from a _command of teams_ to a _team of teams_, and to restructure organizations on the large scale.

What teams need to function well is purpose, trust and connectivity. If those are there, teams can come up autonomously with solutions and implement them on the spot without getting slowed down by management. But this can only work if the team has enough context to make appropriate decision. Information sharing, transparency, and empowered execution is therefore essential so that every team member can understand the whole, achieve a state of shared conciousness with the team, and work together on a “good judgement” solution immediately.

McChrystal illustrates how purpose, trust and connectivity, can be transferred to the scale of organizations so that intra-organizational connections develop that are based on trust rather than strict interfaces, and one organization doesn't get blocked on another.

The book is very well written and has a good structure. Almost every chapter refers high level to a scientific domain that underlies the argument: chaos and complexity theory explain why planning doesn't work for many problems, game theory explains how to overcome the prisoners dilemma with trust, systems theory explains why a holistic view of a system is often required to make the right decision, and other theories are mentioned as well. These references give a solid base to the argument of the book.

If I had to criticise anything it would be that there was sometimes even too much structure and the argument was so well built that there was little doubt and surprise left in the later chapters. That's really a good thing if you want to get the point across but tension drops. Overall I can definitely recommend reading the book!
