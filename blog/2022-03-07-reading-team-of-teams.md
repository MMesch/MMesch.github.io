  I read through another book on team organization: Team of Teams by Stanley McChrystal. Here are my thoughts.
---

Team of Team's is a widely acclaimed book about a leadership model that tries to move away from top-down, hierarchical management to a decentralized “Team of Teams”. McChrystal has developed this approach as response to the US Army's fight against Al-Quaeda in Iraq, because his organization wasn't able to react fast enough to succeed with this challenge.

At the core of the book is the idea that the world has generally become faster paced and more connected than ever before. This makes it a complex system, breaking it apart to study it and then come up with an efficient solution takes way too long to react in a timely manner and is often not even possible. Stratified reductionism and hierarchical approaches that are ideal to optimize static processes for efficiency and that prevail for a good century in many organizations, don't work anymore. Hierarchical command and reductionist thinking and linear thinking («breaking a problem apart») are bottlenecks in many situations. On the other hand, a decentralized structure with it's nonlinear interactions («the sum is more than the parts») can be a lot more powerful, and resilience, that is the ability to recover from mistakes, and agility are more important in a fast-paced world.
The manager in this approach is a “gardener” who follows the eyes on, hands off approach, and tries to work more on producing the right environment than the actual solution.

McChrystal uses the words “command” for a top-down, and “team” for a networked communication structure. The former is good for planned efficiency, the latter for resilience and adaptability. The idea of McChrystal's leadership model, is not only to evolve from command to team. This has already been done frequently with success on the smaller scale, introducing teams of dozens, and that has caused as “command of teams” the same problems on a larger scale. The new idea of the book is to move from this command of teams to a team of teams, and to structure organizations even on the large scale level similar to teams.

And what teams need to function well is purpose, trust and connectivity. In these cases they can come up very quickly with creative bottom-up solutions and implement them on the spot without getting slowed down by management. But this can only work if the team has enough context to take good decision. Information sharing, transparency, and empowered execution is essential for this so that every team member can understand the whole, achieve a state of shared conciousness with the team, and work together on a “good judgement” solution immediately.

The main idea of McChrystal is that these ingredients, purpose, trust and connectivity, can be mirrored on the scale of organizations so that intra-organizational connections develop that are based on trust rather than strict interfaces, and one organization doesn't get blocked on another.

The book is very well written and has a good structure. Almost every chapter refers high level to a scientific domain that underlies the argument: chaos and complexity theory explain why planning doesn't work for many problems, other fields that are touched are game theory to overcome the prisoners dilemma with trust and systems theory that explains why a holistic view of a system is often required to make the right decision.

If I had to criticise anything it would be that there was sometimes even too much structure and the argument was so well built that there was little doubt and surprise left in the later chapters. That's really a good thing if you mostly want to get the point across, but not every situation seems to fit perfectly into this model.

Overall I can definitely recommend reading the book!
