title: Visualizing Invasion Percolation

And another volume render in Blender.
This is based on a percolation simulation using a code written by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ydermasson/">Yder Masson</a>. It can for example describe how a liquid invades a porous rock. The principle is that it advances always at the site of least resistance. The pore resistance follows a statistical distribution that describes the material.
