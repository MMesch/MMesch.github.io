description: |
  We present a method to construct non-stationary and anisotropic second-order random model realizations that can be used for numerical wave propagation simulations in various geometries. Models are generated directly from a given covariance matrix using its eigenvector decomposition (principal component or Karhunen-Lo√®ve method).
