<p>My first post on this blog regards Earth’s free oscillations, also called normal modes. As a string or a 2 dimensional membrane, also a 3 dimensional sphere has “natural” oscillations such that motion at each point is sinusoidal.</p>
<p>The following animations show two spheroidal modes. Their surface movement is in radial and also in tangential direction. The tangential direction is either towards or away from the radial peaks, depending upon the shape of the Eigenfunction.</p>

<p>angular motion is towards radial peaks</p>

<h3 id="spheroidal-mode-l10-m5-fundamental-rayleigh-mode">Spheroidal Mode l=10, m=5 (“Fundamental Rayleigh Mode”)</h3>
<p>angular motion is away from radial peaks</p>
