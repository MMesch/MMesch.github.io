summary: |
  Hi, I am a software developer and project manager and this is the place
  where I write up notes and thoughts about work.
what: |
  I enjoy coordinating projects, deciphering business requirements, looking for
  the best path to making things happen, all the way to implementing hands-on
  if required. For all my life, I have had a strong inclination to sports and
  music and try to apply lessons learned in this world about social life,
  discipline and the connection between body and mind, to the still young and
  sometimes overly intellectual programming industry. My experience living
  across countries in a highly multicultural environment is helpful as well to
  bring together people.
domains: |
  I started my career at University with degrees in general Physics, worked a
  bit in Biophysics, and finally got a PhD in Geophysics working in seismology
  on wave propagation, tomography, and signal processing. The red-line in all
  of these was to understand and implement mathematical models with the
  computer. During this time, I started participating to several Open Source
  projects, and after a Post Doc, I switched fully to the software industry and
  have since worked on and coordinated large industrial projects across
  domains, for example in Quantitative Marketing, Fintech, Biopharma, and
  Aeronautics.
stack: |
  I have worked with a variety of programming languages and frameworks. My
  academic experience turned around large parallel Fortran simulation codes and
  the Python data and machine learning stack. In the industry, I have worked
  with standard technology such as Python, Java Groovy, Ruby, Typescript and
  more specialized purely functional frameworks in Elm, Type- or Purescript, to
  Haskell, implementing backend services, designing specialized libraries, or
  setting up webapps. I discovered and learned to love Nix and NixOS over the
  last years. On the non-programming side, I worked on modeling for a large
  part of my career and have a good understanding of signal processing,
  differential equation solvers, Bayesian statistics, inverse methods and
  data-driven machine learning. In all those fields, I always enjoyed putting
  together nice and effective data visualizations, initially with matplotlib,
  d3.js and nowadays often with Vega.
