  Every day we write repetitive code. A lot of it is boilerplate that you write only to satisfy your compiler/interpreter: code that is not related to the main logic of the program like import and export lists, language extensions, file headers. But how do languages differ in their boilerplate content? Is it only the content of the boilerplate that changes, or also its quantity? We explore these questions using data sets of Python and Haskell code. Besides satisfying our curiosity, we will learn about community-wide habits and realize that after all, repetition is not necessarily uninteresting!
