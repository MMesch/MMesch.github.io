<p>Team of Team’s is an acclaimed book about a decentralized leadership model— a “Team of Teams”. McChrystal has developed this approach as response to the US Army’s fight against Al-Qaeda in Iraq because the top-down, hierarchical management of his organization didn’t allow to react fast enough to the challenges that this situation posed.</p>
<p>The core premise of McChrystal is that the world has become faster paced and more connected than ever before. As a consequence, many organizations are faced with complex systems now that cannot be broken apart and analyzed to come up with efficient plans in a timely manner. Approaching such situations with stratified reductionism and hierarchical structures, ideal to optimized simple and static processes, doesn’t work anymore. Such linear thinking («breaking a problem apart») creates bottlenecks, typically the manager’s brain, and makes organizations slow, ineffective, and unable to offer the right solution at the right moment. A decentralized structure avoids these bottlenecks and furthermore can become more powerful because of nonlinear interactions («the sum is more than the parts»). Decentralized structures are characterized by resilience, that is the ability to recover from mistakes, and agility, that are more important in the fast-paced world than static optimization. A manager in this decentralized approach is not a planner, or heroic leader, but a gardener who fosters, eyes on, hands off, an ecosystem in which an autonomous decentralized network grows.</p>
<p>McChrystal uses the words “command” for the top-down, and “team” for a networked, decentralized communication model. The former is good for planned efficiency but creates bottlenecks, the latter is good for scalability, resilience and adaptability. The idea of McChrystal’s leadership model, is to not only to introduce teams, something that has of course already been done with success, but to take the team idea up from individuals to the organizational level. When teams are often implemented as “command of teams”, where a top-down manager directs teams instead of individuals the same bottlenecks and problems appear on the organizational scale than on the individual. The book thus advocates to move from this <em>command of teams</em> to a <em>team of teams</em>.</p>
<p>Organizations on the large scale need, what teams on the small scale need as well to function: purpose, trust and connectivity. If those are there, teams (and organizations) can come up autonomously with solutions and implement them on the spot without getting slowed down by coordinating management. But this can only work if the team has enough context to make appropriate decision. Information sharing, transparency, and empowered execution is essential in this model so that every team member can understand the whole, achieve a state of shared conciousness with the team, and work together on a “good judgement” solution towards the common purpose immediately. McChrystal illustrates how purpose, trust and connectivity, can be transferred to the scale of organizations.</p>
<p>The book is very well written and has a good structure. Almost every chapter refers high level to a scientific domain that underlies the argument: chaos and complexity theory explain why planning doesn’t work for many problems, game theory explains how to overcome the prisoners dilemma with trust, systems theory explains why a holistic view of a system is often required to make the right decision, and other theories are mentioned as well. These references give a solid base to the argument of the book.</p>
<p>If I had to criticise anything it would be that there was sometimes even too much structure and the argument was so well built that there was little doubt and surprise left in the later chapters. That’s really a good thing if you want to get the point across but tension drops. Overall I can definitely recommend reading the book!</p>
