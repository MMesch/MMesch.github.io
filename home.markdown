# Hi there 

This is a somewhat experimental space with no ambition of perfection and no clear purpose.

The blog is mostly a personal dumping ground for notes from my life as a physicist turned geophysicist turned data engineer.

But then it is also about some little visual experiments from data viz to drawings and paintings.

And finally, who knows what else will appear here over time.

_Have fun reading_
