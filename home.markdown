# Hi there 

This is a somewhat experimental space with no ambition of perfection and no clear purpose.
I work on it from time to time on the weekend.

The blog is mostly a personal dumping ground for notes from my life as a physicist turned geophysicist turned data engineer.
Viz is about some little drawings that I do occasionally.

But finally, who knows what else will appear here over time.
