The interaction of ocean waves that run into each other is the major source of seismic noise in the frequency band between 0.1 and 0.3 Hz all over the Earth.
This animation shows the interaction pressure fluctuations and their dominant frequency, displayed as color lightness and hue, respectively, from 2003 - 2015.
The data shown in this video is based on the wave model WAVEWATCH III.
Seismic recordings permit to monitor such microseisms directly.
